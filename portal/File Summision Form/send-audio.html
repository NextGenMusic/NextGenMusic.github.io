    <summary>I don't have a link to my audio file?</summary>
    <p>To get a link for your audio file, find a file hosting service. The supported service right now would be <a
        href="https://mediafire.com/" target="_blank">Mediafire</a>, but please note you have to create a free account
      or a subscription based account to be able to upload. If you do not do this, the file will be lost before we can
      upload it to our site. Therefore, your request would be invalid.</p>

    <summary>I have my song uploaded on a music service already?</summary>
    <p>Just paste the link to the song you've uploaded and we will upload it as soon as possible. (Fun Fact: Your song
      is more likely to be put on the website faster if with a music service provider...!)</p>
